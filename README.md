# Module 5 Challenge 

# Pyber Ride Sharing Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

This challenge is to compare trends within sets of data. The analysis was done in Pandas mostly using groupby aggregate functions to calculate summary statistics. Fares by City Type were plotted.  

## Results

From the analysis, we learned that

- As expected, there are more rides and drivers in urban cities.
- The average fare is roughly $10 (30%) less in urban cities than rural cities.
- Because there is so much competition and many more drivers in urban cities, the average fare per driver in urban cities is less than half that for rural cities.

## Summary and Recommendations

Based on the results, the number of drivers in urban cities should be limited. In the data used for urban cities, there were more drivers than rides; therefore the drivers are not making as much money as their counterparts in suburban and rural areas. Fares are more expensive in rural areas, so additional drivers could be added there or fares reduced. There were some flucatations in the Total Fares by month, but no signifcant trends were noted.
